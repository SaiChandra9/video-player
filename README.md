# Getting Started with React Player Application


### Project Overview
This video player lets you easily manage and watch your favorite videos. You can browse through a list of pre-selected videos, change their order however you like, or even add and remove videos as you please. Playing and controlling the videos is simple with buttons like "next" and "previous," play/pause, and volume controls. Want to see the video in full screen? Just click a button! Or, adjust the playback speed from 1x to 2x to find your perfect pace. Plus, handy keyboard shortcuts give you quick access to full screen and play/pause functions.
